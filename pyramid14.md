[return](thevoid)

:pyramid14:

The unchanging constant reference point, are not the destinations, it's the climb. The constant unchanging cycle is the reference point. That constant unchaging cycle of equal opposite reaction, that has 5 names here and definitions, are just definitions of the void.

Cycles
The doctrine of five phases describes two cycles, a generating or creation (生 shēng) cycle, also known as "mother-son", and an overcoming or destruction (克 kè) cycle, also known as "grandfather-grandson", of interactions between the phases. Within Chinese medicine the effects of these two main relations are further elaborated:

- Inter-promoting (相生 xiāngshēng): the effect in the generating (生 shēng) cycle
- Weakening (相洩/相泄 xiāngxiè): the effect in a deficient or reverse generating (生 shēng) cycle
- Inter-regulating (相克 xiāngkè): the effect in the overcoming (克 kè) cycle
- Overacting (相乘 xiāngchéng): the effect in an excessive overcoming (克 kè) cycle
- Counteracting (相侮 xiāngwǔ or 相耗 xiānghào): the effect in a deficient or reverse overcoming (克 kè) cycle

1) Inter-promoting
Common verbs for the shēng cycle include "generate", "create" or "strengthens", as well as "grow" or "promote". The phase interactions in the shēng cycle are:

Wood feeds Fire
Fire produces Earth (ash, lava)
Earth bears Metal (geological processes produce minerals)
Metal collects Water (water vapor condenses on metal, for example)
Water nourishes Wood (Water flowers, plants and others changes in forest)

2) Weakening
A deficient shēng cycle is called the xiè cycle and is the reverse of the shēng cycle. Common verbs for the xiè include "weaken", "drain", "diminish" or "exhaust". The phase interactions in the xiè cycle are:

Earth absorbs Water
Water extinguishes Fire
Fire melt Metal
Metal cuts down Wood (overmining or over-extraction of the earth's minerals)
Wood (plants) degrades Earth (soil)

3) Inter-regulating
Common verbs for the kè cycle include "controls", "restrains" and "fathers", as well as "overcome" or "regulate". The phase interactions in the kè cycle are:

Wood parts (or stabilizes) Earth (roots of trees can prevent soil erosion)
Earth contains (or directs) Water (dams or river banks)
Water dampens (or regulates) Fire
Fire melts (or refines or shapes) Metal
Metal chops (or carves) Wood

4) Overacting
An excessive kè cycle is called the chéng cycle. Common verbs for the chéng cycle include "restrict", "overwhelm", "dominate" or "destroy". The phase interactions in the chéng cycle are:

Wood depletes Earth (depletion of nutrients in soil, over-farming, overcultivation)
Earth obstructs Water (over-damming)
Water extinguishes Fire
Fire vaporizes Metal
Metal overharvests Wood (deforestation)

5) Counteracting
A deficient kè cycle is called the wǔ cycle and is the reverse of the kè cycle. Common verbs for the wǔ cycle can include "insult" or "harm". The phase interactions in the wǔ cycle are:

Wood dulls Metal
Metal de-energizes Fire (metals conduct heat away)
Fire evaporates Water
Water muddies (or destabilizes) Earth
Earth rots Wood (overpiling soil on wood can rot the wood)

To create a new diary note for a present day, type this command <\w\w>. An empty buffer will be opened on for you to type your diary note for the day.You may then save that diary note. And it will be saved as a diary markdown file, named on that present date. And then all you have to do to access that saved diary during that same day, is to type that same command <\w\w> again. And in order to check the links for all your diary notes, which may be already written on several days, simply open the diary index markdown file, by typing <\-wi>. Initially, you will just be on a blank space, so type \w\i to regenerate the entries for that vimwiki index diary markdown file. https://jnduli.co.ke/keeping-diary-in-vim.html

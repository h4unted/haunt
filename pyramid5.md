[thevoid](thevoid)

Aside from knowing the void, one should also know how
special each elements are, and by doing so one will be able
to see each special elements one at a time in a very very
big chain. And not to be confused seeing only small
repetitive loops of the same elements, which are actually
never the same. Because if you think any two elements are
the same in the chain of time, you will end up pairing two
unrelated elements. After realizing one element, really is
special, you realize its very important to not put
distractions in everything_like intervening an element which
is not actually related to it_just like studying with loud
music on_making it harder for you to find the real pair of
each special element_which is like suddenly starting up a
music on its chorus, or suddenly stopping a music.

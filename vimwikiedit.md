[return](vimwiki)

:edit:

Editing texts in vimwiki can be done without using the mouse. You can navigate and edit in [normal](normalmode) mode. Select and edit in [visual](visual) mode. And then edit texts in [insert](insertmode) mode. With these 3 modes of editing, being able to only use the keyboard without the need of using the mouse, makes you edit texts at the speed of thought.

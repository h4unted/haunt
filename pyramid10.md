[return](thevoid)

:pyramid10:

A point of reference can only be described as a kind of justice, a kind of equal opposite reaction, and all of it is just a kind of void. And if it can't be described as such, meaning, it can not be a point of reference, it will just be another unequal duality. And with a lacking element of duality, in a continuity, that continual reference point of void, which can be sensed in zanshin, will also not exist.

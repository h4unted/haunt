:vimwiki:

The very most important thing about taking notes in vim is about assigning a [tag](tag) to the main point, or reference point, of all that is discussed on a markdown document. The second most important thing in vimwiki is also how to set it up, so that accidental changes, will be [unsaved](unsaved), or accidental pressing of keys that may trigger [highlighting](highlighting) will be unhighlighted. Including the elemination of a bug that makes text [appear](textappear) to another markdown document when switching to them from a link. The advantage of using vimwiki from any other proprietary text editor is for one to be able to [edit](vimwikiedit) texts without using the mouse, making you edit texts with the speed of thought. Through the keyboard only.

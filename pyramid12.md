[return](thevoid)

:pyramid12:

When you are seeing the whole picture of the combined +1 and -2 or the combined +2 or -3, and so on and so forth till the combined +7 and -8. Little do you know, that the 1,2,3,4,5,6,7 and 8 are all just one positive side of the negative 8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1. When the whole big picture really is the +12345678 and the -87654321. You must step back to see the real big picture, which is the void. Without seeing it you are just under a false guide, a false reference point.

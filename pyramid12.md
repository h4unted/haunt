[return](thevoid)

:pyramid12:

When you are seeing the whole picture of the combined +1 and -2 or the combined +2 or -3, and so on and so forth till the combined +7 and -8. Little do you know, that the 1,2,3,4,5,6,7 and 8 are all just one positive side of the negative 8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1. When the whole big picture really is the +12345678 and the -87654321. You must step back to see the real big picture, which is the void. Without seeing it you are just under a false guide, a false reference point.

And it's not that, +12345678 and -87654321 need to be directly linked suceeding each other in the course of time. Because both can exist together in distant time and distance. The time and distance that separates them does not matter. It's knowing and doing both as they are truly one, that matters. And also take note these pyramidical understanding of layers of duality, is far more advanced than the understanding of the 5 elements star. It is exactly explained within the freemason church brick layer seeing the big picture allegory and the dream within a dream inception allegory.

And when knowing that the focal point is the void you already know that the dualities under it are the, +12345678 and the -12345678. And you also already know that dualities under +12345678 are the +1 -2 +3 -4 +5 -6 +7 -8, and the dualities under -12345678 are the +1 -2 +3 -4 +5 -6 +7 -8.

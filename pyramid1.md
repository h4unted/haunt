[return](thevoid)

:pyramid:

A reference point is equal to dualities combined. Although it
does not exist on this lower plane, it guides dualities to
exist in pairs, together in succession. Which therefore
gives order to a chain of changes. A certain kind of duality
can not exist before or after just any duality, but only
with specific dualities in perfect pair with it. And although
the chain of duality changes, the reference point which they
simply are derived from is a constant. And to avoid suffering
or confusion, that constant must be a point of balance,
justice or void. Which can be decribed as courage,
perseverance, love or any fair virtue.

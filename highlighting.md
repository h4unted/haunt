:highlighting:

When accidentally pressing <shift-3> or <#> while the cursur is on a word, a word will be highlighted. You can disable highlighting by typing the command <:nohlsearch> or <:nohl>. It will clear the current highlight, but leave you in hlsearch mode for the next search.

And also <ctrl-l> redraws the screen and removes any search highlighting.

Typing the command <:set nohlsearch> turns off search highlighting completely
